Francisco Rendón


Rendón, Francisco. Jerez de la Frontera (Cádiz), c. 1760 - Mexico, 1821 post. Diplomat and intendant.

Son of Juana García and Pedro Rendón, a shoemaker by trade. At a very young age he was placed in a trading house in Cádiz, where he made some relationships that allowed him to move to America.

In 1779 he was appointed secretary to Juan de Miralles, in charge of a secret commission from Cuba for General Washington.

When Miralles died in Philadelphia (April 20, 1780), he was succeeded by Rendón (October 20), until his appointment as secretary of legation of Diego Gardoquí, chargé d'affaires of Spain in the United States (September 29, 1784). This diplomat, not very favorable to Rendón's marriage plan with a young Protestant woman (January 30, 1786), caused him to be summoned to Madrid (April 16).

Arriving at the Court in February 1787, Rendón retained half of his salary while awaiting a new posting (July 19, 1788) and, in the meantime, was consulted by Floridablanca on the organization of consular relations between Spain and the United States.

After much hesitation, he accepted the appointment of quartermaster of Louisiana, with the honors of quartermaster of the Army (December 9, 1793), embarked at Cadiz on April 1, 1794, arrived in New Orleans on August 5, and took up his post on September 1. Soon transferred to the intendancy of Zacatecas in New Spain (August 22, 1795), he took possession of it on April 18, 1796. Finally he was named quartermaster of Oaxaca (August 29, 1816), keeping this position until June 30, 1821, the last known information of his career.

The problem of his marriage remains unresolved.

In 1785 he asked for a license to marry Margarita Marschall, daughter of Protestant merchants of New York. In spite of the young woman's intention to convert to Catholicism, Gardoquí was very reluctant, referring the decision to Floridablanca.

The latter, after calling Rendón to Spain, dragged his feet on the matter, despite repeated requests from the interested party.

It is not known if, upon his return to America, he was able to make his longed-for liaison a reality.
