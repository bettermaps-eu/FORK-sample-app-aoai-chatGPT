He was born into a family belonging to the local nobility. His father, Joaquín de Onís y López, a native of Cantalapiedra (July 1, 1730), had been mayor of that town as a representative of the nobility in 1785, 1790 and 1791, and was exempt from royal service due to this noble status in 1783. and 1790. His mother, Narcisa González Bara, born in Rasueros (Ávila) on April 30, 1735, obtained testimony there, on May 16, 1792, that her ancestors on both branches were exempt from chests and distributions by nobles.

After studying Literature and Law at the University of Salamanca, he continued his training alongside his uncle José de Onís, plenipotentiary minister in Dresden. In 1780 he joined him, serving as private secretary until, due to a permit requested by him on August 14, 1784, which became a definitive departure, he remained as chargé d'affaires until the arrival of his successor, Quiñones, three years later. years later (November 1, 1791). He was then rewarded with the position of secretary of that Ministry (December 31), returning to take charge of business between Quiñones' departure and his own (March 11, 1797-January 26, 1799). Meanwhile, he was appointed eighth (November 3, 1798) and seventh (November 26, 1798) officer of the Secretariat of the Office of State. He arrived in Spain in May 1790 to take possession of the position of sixth officer (March 9, 1799). In the following years he followed regular promotions, being promoted to fifth officer (March 13, 1800), fourth (February 10, 1801), third (May 25, 1802), second (October 19, 1802) and major. second (May 9, 1806). In 1808 he accompanied the Royal Family to Bayonne, until on May 14 he was ordered to return to Spain to take care of the business that he had been entrusted with as an officer of the Secretariat of the Office of State. After the events of that year he joined the Central Government Board and, in January 1809, he was promoted to first major officer. In addition, he was appointed secretary of the Royal and Distinguished Order of Charles III (January 29). On June 28, he left the Secretariat for having been appointed extraordinary envoy and plenipotentiary minister in the United States.


He arrived in New York on October 4, but was not officially admitted as a diplomatic representative of Spain to avoid problems with Napoleon. For this reason, and with hardly any official news, in the following years he went through certainly difficult times. Finally recognized in 1815, he negotiated with President Adams a “Treaty of Friendship, Settlement of Differences and Limits” of the two countries' possessions in America (Washington, February 22, 1819). In March 1819 he returned to Spain, where he was arrested and imprisoned in his residence in Cantalapiedra due to the criticism raised by the American treaty. To justify his conduct, the following year he published a work entitled Memoir on the negotiations between Spain and the United States of America, which gave rise to the treaty of 1819. Justified and released, he was given the position of honorary counselor of State (December 17 of 1819). Shortly before, on November 28, he had been proposed to take charge of the Russian legation. He refused the position, but accepted the embassy to Naples (March 19, 1820), where he arrived on July 19. It seems that he contributed effectively to the liberal revolution that took place in that country, and he is even credited with authoring a pamphlet titled Counterrevolution of Naples. From there he went to London as extraordinary envoy and plenipotentiary minister (February 2, 1821). He ceased his duties on October 17, 1822, in consequence of the suppression of his position, but remained in London for two more years. In 1824 he went to Paris and then to Montauban, where his brother Joachim lived. He returned to Madrid in 1826, and there he died on May 27, 1827.


On August 9, 1788, while secretary in Dresden, he had married Federica Cristina Juana de Mercklein (Dresden, March 5, 1767-Washington, May 30, 1807). They had three children: Mauricio (1790-1861), Narcisa and Clementina. He was a knight pensioner of the Royal and Distinguished Order of Carlos III by decree of April 13, 1792, honorary academic of the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando (January 4, 1801) and, in 1817, he received the Grand Cross of the Order of Isabella the Catholic.
