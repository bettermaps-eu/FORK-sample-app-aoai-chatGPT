Félix Berenguer de Marquina y Fitz-Gerald.

Berenguer de Marquina y Fitz-Gerald, Félix. Alicante, 1736 - 1826. Marine, governor and captain general of the Philippines, viceroy of New Spain.

Born into a Spanish-Irish family, at the age of seventeen he began his military life as a cadet in the Queen's Infantry Regiment (1753) and a few months later he became a marine guard at the Naval College of Cadiz (1754). In the course of his studies he showed special aptitude in the disciplines of Mathematics and Navigation and obtained some prizes in contests that dealt with them (1756).

At the age of twenty he embarked, for the first time, on the ship Europa (October 10, 1756) and, once again on land, he was appointed third teacher of Mathematics in the School of Marine Guards (1757) and was in charge of teaching various subjects until he reached the position of second teacher (1768).

While he dedicated himself to teaching, he was promoted in the Navy, beginning with the rank of frigate ensign (1757) and continuing with those of naval ensign (1760), frigate lieutenant (1769) and naval lieutenant (1776), after which he was appointed director of the Pilots Corps of the Naval Department of Cartagena and entered the Order of Santiago (1776). Later he was promoted to frigate captain (1779) and naval captain (1780) and continued stationed in Cartagena, during which time he wrote some works of his discipline, such as an opinion on some points that should be established in the Corps of Pilots for the better service of the King and the Navy, a description of the route that should be followed from the Bay of Cadiz to the various landings that are made in the Windward Islands, to various ports in America, and another of the route from Martinique to Maracaibo, Santa Marta and Cartagena.

Once he was forty years old, he was appointed president, governor and captain general of the Philippine Islands in place of José Basco y Vargas, and his titles were issued by Royal Provisions dated in El Pardo (March 22, 1787) and he took possession of these jobs in Manila a little more than a year later (July 1, 1788).

Like most of his predecessors, he showed a special concern for the military defense of the islands and for their commerce and thus, during his government, he was involved in the establishment of a shipyard and in the attempt to arm a small fleet of galleys, together with proposing a New Plan of Government (January 23, 1790) according to which he estimated that the islands could be maintained without the need for the annual situado of two hundred and forty-four thousand pesos that was sent from Mexico and, in addition, it would allow the increase of troops for the due security and protection of its government, by means of the main measure of opening the port of Manila to European commerce, without forgetting that he also proposed the creation of a viceroyalty in the Philippines, as a proportionate measure to guarantee the presence of the Monarchy in them and to consolidate its position in Asia, above all in the face of the threat of other European powers.

During the second year of his government (1789) he had to face an epidemic of smallpox that affected the city of Manila causing great devastation, especially among the native population, and whose bad consequences he alleviated with a series of measures, contributing with his own money to help those affected. Shortly after, he also intervened in the project of a new cemetery for Manila (1792), in compliance with the Royal Decree on cemeteries outside the towns (March 27, 1789), and in the last months of his mandate (July 10, 1793) he sent the Marquis of Bajamar a French seditious paper, dated April 23 of that year, which had been introduced in Manila, although it had not been divulged, and in which the regime of the French Republic was exalted and the "despotism" of the Spanish Crown was censured.

The climate of the Philippine Islands caused his health to deteriorate quickly, which together with his lack of vision moved him, two years after his arrival in Manila, to request that he be relieved from the Government and ordered to take up residence (January 23, 1790). This request was well received in Madrid and thus, by a Royal Order dated in San Ildefonso (August 29, 1792), the Marquis of Bajamar was informed that the request of Berenguer de Marquina had been granted and by another Royal Decree dated in Aranjuez (February 19, 1793), the regent of the Royal Court of the Philippines was entrusted with the task, Agustín Ignacio de Emparán y Orbe, to immediately take the judgment of residence to the outgoing governor, who, months later, handed over the command to his successor, Rafael María de Aguilar (September 1, 1793), and remained in Manila until the last days of July of 1794, time in which he embarked towards the port of Acapulco and from there passed to that of Veracruz, from where he wrote to the Count of Campo Alange, to thank him for his relief of the Government of the Philippines and to communicate that he was waiting for the occasion to pass to Veracruz to go to the kingdoms of Spain in the first ship of war that there was (November 25, 1794).

On his return to the kingdoms of Spain he was promoted to chief of the squadron (1795); However, a short time later, after consultation with the Council of the Indies and having seen the records of his residence in the Philippines, by Royal Resolution dated Aranjuez (17 June 1797) it was agreed that Berenguer de Marquina would not be given a job in the Indies that had political command attached to it, without this affecting his promotions and commands in his career, nor for other posts of a different nature, and this explains why he was later promoted to lieutenant general of the Navy (1799).

In the same year of his last promotion, by Royal Decree dated San Lorenzo (November 8, 1799) Charles IV decided to relieve Miguel José de Azanza of the viceroyalty of New Spain and entrust it to Félix Berenguer de Marquina, also appointed governor, captain general and president of the Royal Court of Mexico, who immediately prepared to embark for his destination in the midst of the turmoil caused by the hostilities with England.

He made the voyage aboard the mail brigantine El Cuervo, which had left La Coruña on December 21, 1799, but after making stops in Tenerife and Margarita Island, at seven o'clock in the morning of March 17, 1800, in the sound of Campeche, it was captured by the English war frigate La Alarma, which was crossing over Cape Catoche, and a large part of its crew was sent in a merchant schooner to the port of Veracruz. But the English detained the provided viceroy Berenguer de Marquina, the brigadier Antonio de Bonilla, who later acted as secretary of the viceroyalty, and another part of the crew, who were taken to the port of Kingston, in Jamaica. The viceroy obtained his freedom there after agreeing with Commander Hyde Parker that he would not take command of a squadron or ship during the war with England, after which he was authorized to go to the port of Veracruz on a Spanish schooner that had arrived in Jamaica with English prisoners, and so he embarked on March 27, 1800, to arrive in Veracruz on April 11, 1800.

The circumstances of his trip, imprisonment and subsequent release marked the beginning of his viceregal government, due to the reluctance shown by the Royal Audiencia of Mexico to allow him to freely take command. In fact, the regent Baltasar Ladrón de Guevara summoned the Royal Agreement on April 15, 1800, and in the presence of the viceroy, who did not vote, he informed the auditors and prosecutors that there was "no record of the way and terms in which he left the power of the enemies, that is, whether or not he was bound by some bond not to take arms against that power during the present war", for which reason it was necessary to know the terms in which Berenguer de Marquina had achieved his freedom. Berenguer reported what had happened during his imprisonment in Jamaica, and having learned of everything that had happened, "they said that they obeyed and obeyed the aforementioned Royal Decree of S. M. "But they agreed to put testimony in the file of the circumstances in which the viceroy left the power of the English, the prosecutor being of the opinion of blindly obeying the Royal Decree without any procedure or diligence, so that, finally, in the Royal Agreement of the following April 20, it was decided to put as testimony Berenguer's answer in which he said he was not bound by any impediment to take the defense of the viceroyalty if an English attack took place. After all this, Berenguer de Marquina took command in Guadalupe on April 29 and the following day he entered Mexico City, where he took the customary oath and took possession of his duties.

To this polemic beginning of his government followed an incident with the Cabildo of Mexico City, which, as it was in use for the reception of the viceroys of the New Spain, asked him for permission to celebrate bullfights on the occasion of his entrance in the viceroyalty, but Berenguer de Marquina did not consent to it (September 11, 1800) for considering that it was a spectacle contrary to "the moral and the political" and of great cost for the Royal Treasury, decision that would always be remembered in posterity as one of the causes of the severe judgment that a good part of the nineteenth-century Mexican historiography made of his capacities.

A good part of his little more than two years of government was marked by the situation derived from the war with England, and thus, in the same year of his inauguration (1800), he was especially concerned that the Board of the Royal Treasury agreed on everything necessary to aid and help the provinces of Florida and Louisiana, putting them under cover from any English attack; The following year (1801) he went to the port of Veracruz to inspect its defenses and those of its coasts and to give the necessary orders for the maintenance of lookouts in them and to order the repair and maintenance of its roads. In this same war environment, another of his main concerns was to ensure the transport of wealth from America to Spain during wartime, for which the establishment of the Real Giro de Letras (Royal Giro of Letters) had been foreseen, an arbitration that Berenguer de Marquina felt implied "serious inconveniences and insurmountable difficulties", and therefore proposed (October 6, 1801) a series of measures to avoid these problems, Among them was to authorize the negotiation with the North American colonies to supply the viceroyalty with quicksilver and paper, which would also have the effect of combating smuggling from those colonies, and the permanent arrival of ships of that origin to the northern coasts of the viceroyalty, which was one of the most common concerns of his government.

Also during his period of government there was a series of alterations derived from the uprisings of some natives and the real or supposed plans to promote the separation of the viceroyalty from the Monarchy, some of which had been conceived in the time of his predecessor, and in part were related to the eventual support of the English or the inhabitants of the North American colonies.

Two months after his arrival (June 1800) in the viceregal capital, a "seditious" project was discovered involving Francisco Antonio Vázquez Fernández, a native of Cádiz and a pilot, who was placed in the Royal Jail of the Acordada and in whose cause, followed by the mayor of the Crime Manuel del Castillo y Negrete, news of alleged plans for a "seditious" project were heard, there was news of supposed plans of some prominent neighbors of the city with the purpose of "separating these dominions from the Metropolis with the help of England", although everything turned out to be a plot that had little of truth and to which the Court did not pay greater attention. In 1801 there was greater cause for concern, especially due to the uprising of the "Mariano Indian" in the region of Nayarit and the adventures of the adventurer Felipe Nolan in the province of Texas.

In the first days of the year 1801 the uprising of the "Indian Mariano" took place, supposedly son of the governor of the town of Tlaxcala, who, by means of a letter that he made circulate among the governors and mayors of the Indian towns, summoned the natives to meet in the town of Tepic (January 5, 1801), where he would make his entrance as "king of the Indies", but this note reached the knowledge of the subdelegate, Tomás de Escobedo, who informed the president of the Real Audiencia de la Nueva Galicia, José Fernando de Abascal. Immediately the necessary measures were taken and thus the Indians who gathered in the surroundings of Tepic were arrested (January 5, 1801), and the viceroy was informed of the beginning of the processes, although in the following days there were new skirmishes with other natives who continued going to Tepic and there was more than some alarm due to the information of the possible intervention of the English in this uprising. The viceroy limited himself to warn that the communication of the Indians be cut off, preventing them from gathering, that their complaints be investigated and that the bishop instruct the clergymen and religious to urge the natives to quietness and submission to the Monarchy, With these measures this movement was dissolved, although the "Indian Mariano" could not be stopped and for a long time his image and the rumors of his uprisings and even the attempt to burn the temple of the Virgin of Guadalupe and blow up the Viceroy's palace to kill him. In that same year of 1801, fears were also experienced due to the adventures of the adventurer Felipe Nolan in the internal provinces, who, aided by Indians and some North American settlers, planned to set up an establishment in them to collect the cattle existing there, benefiting them in the United States, But after having pursued him and having killed him in combat and captured his followers, the viceroy ordered that the borders of Nuevo Santander and Nuevo Reino de León be kept in the best state of defense to prevent possible Indian uprisings.

Berenguer de Marquina was occupied in diverse matters of the ordinary government, such as the construction of the equestrian statue of Charles IV for the square of Mexico, the decent dress of the population and the authorization so that the women could work in everything that did not oppose to the decorum and to their forces, but apparently the viceroyalty was never a comfortable destination for him and thus, promptly, he manifested to the Court his desire to be a viceroy, he expressed to the Court his desire to abandon it and by Royal Decree of July 14, 1802 he was informed that his resignation had been accepted and that José de Iturrigaray had been appointed to replace him in command, who arrived in Mexico at the end of 1802, and to whom Berenguer handed over the command in the first days of the following year (January 4, 1803), having been commissioned to take up residence of his predecessor (March 22, 1803).

Once he left his jobs, Berenguer de Marquina retired immediately to the town of Jalapa, and from there he moved to the port of Veracruz, where on February 11 he embarked on the corvette Mari Rita of the La Coruña trade and on May 10 of that year he arrived at the port of Santander. He settled in the city of Murcia, of whose Society of Friends of the Country he was a member, and after short stays in Tarragona and Valencia, he settled in his hometown of Alicante, where he was surprised by death.

He had married María Ansoategui, a native of Cádiz and daughter of a factor of the Compañía Guipuzcoana de Comercio, a marriage from which Joaquín Berenguer de Marquina was born.
